# Propositional-Logic-Calculator
A propositional logic calculator developed in Java.

This project is made following the completion of our Discrete Mathematics class at Concordia Univeristy (COMP-232).

This project will be completed in the following manner:
  1. Understand the concept of propositional logic and its operations (such as AND, OR, NOT, etc.)
  2. Identify the set of propositional symbols that will be used in the calculator.
  3. Decide on the data structure to represent the propositional formulas, such as a binary tree.
  4. Implement methods for parsing string inputs into the chosen data structure.
  5. Implement methods for evaluating propositional formulas using the chosen data structure.
  6. Implement methods for handling the logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, etc.)
  7. Write the main method that handles user input and calls the appropriate methods for parsing, evaluating, and outputting the result.
  8. Test the program with a variety of propositional formulas to ensure that it is working correctly.
  9. Consider adding additional features such as handling tautologies and contradictions, or converting propositional formula to conjuctive or disjunctive form.
